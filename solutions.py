#9 Sort the following list of SSH Ids in ascending order

ssh_list = [1331903959.94555, 1331901011.84795, 1331903492.37203, 1331901032.03789, 1331903508.24007, 1331903476.8]

ssh_list.sort()
print(ssh_list)

#print the list in descending order
ssh_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(ssh_list)

#11 Find the smallest integet in the network list below:

network_list = [39104, 38694, 38702, 38787, 39860]

print(min(network_list))

#sum() calculates the sum of the all the elements in the list
#12 Find the sum of the following occurence list below:

occurences = [3, 2.5, 9, 7, 21, 6, 8]
print(sum(occurences))
